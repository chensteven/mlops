## MLOps Training
### End-to-end model training and deployment using PyTorch Lightning, Fast API and Docker
#### Multi-label text classification
##### Prepared by WecloudData

In this project, we will train and deploy a PyTorch machine learning model to production environment using FastAPI and Docker. The goal is to serve a trained model as API endpoints inside a Docker container with CUDA support, on a local and remote cloud linux machine. 

This tutorial aims to prepare Data Scientists or Machine Learning Engineers for ML Model deployment.

To do:
- documentation
- upload lectures to the right place
